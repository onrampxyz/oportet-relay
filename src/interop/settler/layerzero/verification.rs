//! # LayerZero Verification Monitoring
//!
//! This module provides utilities for monitoring LayerZero message verifications.
//! It maintains one subscription per (destination chain, receive library) combination to minimize
//! connections while serving multiple concurrent verification requests through broadcast channels.
//!
//! Different settler addresses on the same chain may use different receive libraries, so we need
//! to monitor the specific receive library that will process each packet.
